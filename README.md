DOKO WEBSITE FOR FRONTEND FRENZY I have used simple HTML, CSS and Javascript to create the frontend. Altogether i have redesigned 3 webpages for DOKO.(HOME PAGE, LOGIN PAGE AND ABOUT PAGE)
HOME PAGE(index.html) I have created a dynamic hompage with changing titles every 5 seconds with the help of Javasscript. I have used a video as my page background. The title changes from eng to nep and vice versa every 5secs. I decided to created a navbar component for the reusability of the same navbar in all my other pages
LOGIN PAGE(login.html) I created a simple login page which can be accessed from the navbar.
About US PAGE(aboutus.html) It consists of a description of the website and more info about the college and students with the use of icons.
REUSABILITY OF NAVBAR As the navbar is needed for every page, i created a component js file so that it can be called by after the script src is written on the head.
Additional Features 1.Dropdown effect for batches and clubs on navbar 2.Easy Links for Social Media of College in navbar 3.Favicon of original doko website 4. Nepali Typography 5. RESPONSIVE DESIGN
